# A-blockchain-simulation
This project is a simplified implementation of a blockchain to help you understand the core concepts behind how blockchains work. It includes fundamental features like block creation, hashing with SHA-256, proof-of-work mining, hash chaining, validation, and tampering detection.

---

## Features

- Block structure with:
  - Index
  - Timestamp
  - List of transactions
  - Hash of the previous block
  - Current block hash
  - Nonce for mining
- Blockchain structure with:
  - Genesis block creation
  - Block mining using Proof-of-Work
  - Chain validation
  - Transaction pool
  - Tampering detection
- Proof-of-Work mechanism (hash must start with specific number of zeros)
- Fully modular and well-commented Python code

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses standard libraries only)

---

## Setup & Execution Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dudedope/A-blockchain-simulation.git
cd A-blockchain-simulation
```

Or download the `.ipynb` notebook and open it in Jupyter/Colab.

---

### 2. Run the Script

If you're using the notebook (`.ipynb`):

- Open in Jupyter or Google Colab
- Run all cells sequentially

---

## Code Overview

### Block Class

Represents each block in the chain. Contains:
- `index`: Position in the chain
- `timestamp`: Time of creation
- `transactions`: Data stored
- `previous_hash`: Hash of the previous block
- `nonce`: Used in Proof-of-Work
- `hash`: Current block's hash

### Blockchain Class

Handles the full blockchain:
- Creates genesis block
- Stores chain
- Handles pending transactions
- Mines blocks with a proof-of-work algorithm
- Validates chain integrity
- Detects tampering

### Proof-of-Work

A basic hash puzzle: finding a nonce such that the block's SHA-256 hash starts with `n` zeros. The difficulty level controls how many leading zeros are required.

## üîç Example Output

```bash
Mining Block #1...
Block #1 mined: 000ac9d0f...

Mining Block #2...
Block #2 mined: 000bba4b8...

=== Validating Blockchain ===
Is chain valid? True

=== Tampering with Blockchain ===
Tampering with Block #1...
Is chain valid? False
```
